# Why is Scottish Country Dancing Awesomeâ€½

Scottish Country Dancing is an international hobby, with over 300 groups dancing worldwide. Dancers organize and attend a local class as part of a branch of the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society (RSCDS). Scottish Country Dance is a type of folk dance that is highly social and welcoming to all, regardless of age, gender or experience level. Learn more at [the RSCDS website](https://rscds.org/get-involved/new-scottish-country-dancing).
